# Esperanto__A_Cross_Linguistic_Examination

This report examines the hypothesis that Esperanto, a constructed international language, has evolved to exhibit more similari ties with Turkish — a non-Indo-European language — than with Spanish, a European language closely related to Esperanto’s primary lexical contributors. Utilizing sentence pairs translated among Esperanto, Turkish, and Spanish, this study employs a series of linguistic metrics, including average word length,
character-word ratio, and direct comparison of character and word counts between languages. My analysis, based on statistical computations and visual data representations, indicates that contrary to the initial hypothesis, Esperanto shares closer structural characteristics with Spanish than with Turkish.
